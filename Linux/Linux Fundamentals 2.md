# Notes During the Room:

1. SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for secure remote access to Linux machines.
2. SSH encrypts data sent between devices for security.
3. Basic SSH login syntax: `ssh username@ip_address`
4. Many commands accept arguments (flags or switches) to modify their behavior.
5. The `--help` option and `man` pages provide information about command usage.
6. Important file and directory manipulation commands:

   | Command | Full Name | Purpose |
   |---------|-----------|---------|
   | touch   | touch     | Create file |
   | mkdir   | make directory | Create a folder |
   | cp      | copy      | Copy a file or folder |
   | mv      | move      | Move a file or folder |
   | rm      | remove    | Remove a file or folder |
   | file    | file      | Determine the type of a file |

7. File permissions in Linux determine who can read, write, or execute files.
8. The `su` command is used to switch between users.
9. Important root directories:
   - /etc: Stores system configuration files
   - /var: Stores variable data like logs
   - /root: Home directory for the root user
   - /tmp: Temporary storage, cleared on reboot
