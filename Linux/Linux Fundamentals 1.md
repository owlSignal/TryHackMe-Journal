# Notes During the Room:

- Linux is an OS, like Windows. There are many different versions of Linux that serve different purposes.
- Linux systems rely more heavily on the command line to do tasks, like navigate the file system.

  | Command | Full Name |
  |---------|-----------|
  | ls      | listing   |
  | cd      | change directory |
  | cat     | concatenate |
  | pwd     | print working directory |

- The `find` command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
- The `grep` command is used to search for specific patterns within files.

- Important shell operators:

  | Symbol / Operator | Description |
  |-------------------|-------------|
  | &                 | Run commands in the background |
  | &&                | Combine multiple commands |
  | >                 | Redirect output (overwrite) |
  | >>                | Redirect output (append) |
